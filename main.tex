% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
% \usepackage{cite}
\usepackage[noadjust]{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
\graphicspath{{Figures/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% Do NOT use the amsbsy package under comsoc mode as that feature is
% already built into the Times Math font (newtxmath, mathtime, etc.).
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% Select a Times math font under comsoc mode or else one will automatically
% be selected for you at the document start. This is required as Communications
% Society journals use a Times, not Computer Modern, math font.
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% The freely available newtxmath package was written by Michael Sharpe and
% provides a feature rich Times math font. The cmintegrals option, which is
% the default under IEEEtran, is needed to get the correct style integral
% symbols used in Communications Society journals. Version 1.451, July 28,
% 2015 or later is recommended. Also, do *not* load the newtxtext.sty package
% as doing so would alter the main text font.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
%
% Alternatively, you can use the MathTime commercial fonts if you have them
% installed on your system:
%\usepackage{mtpro2}
%\usepackage{mt11p}
%\usepackage{mathtime}


%\usepackage{bm}
% The bm.sty package was written by David Carlisle and Frank Mittelbach.
% This package provides a \bm{} to produce bold math symbols.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/bm





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.

  We present a prediction model that assesses the future risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We use the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data collected from a group of 1,551  healthy subjects to construct a machine learning model employing the support vector machines. We trained and validated the models on the data obtained from the second cohort of the San Antonio Heart Study, using a set of four features derived from the glucose measurements in the OGTT. The results of the proposed scheme show an average validation accuracy of 97.23\% and recall of 77.27\%. The results also show that the plasma glucose based features are the strongest predictors of the future development of T2DM.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} global incidence of diabetes was estimated at \num{422} million in the year \num{2014} and its prevalence among the adult population has seen an increase from \SI{4.7}{\percent} in the year \num{1980} to \SI{8.5}{\percent} in \num{2014} \cite{mathers_projections_2006}. In \num{2015} alone, an estimated \num{1.6} million deaths worldwide were attributed to diabetes. In addition, a diabetic patient is at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, visual impairment and limb amputations, as compared to a non-diabetic person. Due to the substantial socio-economic burdens that are associated with diabetes, its early detection, intervention and prevention has become a worldwide top-level health concern.


%%% TALK ABOUT GLUCOSE TOLERANCE
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), defined by World Health Organization (WHO) \cite{organization_definition_2006} and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) \cite{american_diabetes_association_diagnosis_2005}, that is used to detect diabetes in its early stage, known as pre-diabetes, which identifies the impaired insulin response. Glucose clamp techniques can quantify the IGT. However, such techniques are labor-intensive and complicated for clinical practice or large epidemiological studies. A less invasive technique to quantify IGT involves an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that samples the blood concentration of glucose and insulin over \SI{2}{\hour} after a standardized glucose dose  \cite{tschritter_assessing_2003}. However, the studies have shown that only \SI{50}{\percent} of such cases actually develop diabetes within a span of \num{10} years \cite{shaw_impaired_1999, writing_committee_impaired_2002}. Moreover, \SI{40}{\percent} diabetic subjects do not show any IGT in the initial screening. Previous studies have shown that extended OGTT, that assesses the blood glucose and insulin in the period prior to \SI{2}{\hour} limit, can predict diabetes onset more reliably \cite{abdul-ghani_what_2007}.


%%% TALK ABOUT INSULIN RESISTANCE
In this paper, we revisit the data generated by a population-based, epidemiological study, the San Antonio Heart Study \cite{burke_rapid_1999, lorenzo_trend_2006}, and use a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes by using predefined OGTT features used earlier in the literature. On top of a range of glucose and insulin concentrations and their derivatives, our approach also takes into account physiological factors such as age, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI).

\section{Materials and Methods}
%
\subsection{San Antonio Heart Study}
%
We developed the diabetes prediction models using the data extracted from a population-based epidemiological study, the San Antonio Heart Study (SAHS). The aim of the SAHS was to assess the risk factors of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases \cite{burke_rapid_1999, lorenzo_trend_2006}, for which \num[group-minimum-digits=4, group-separator = {,}]{5158} men and non-pregnant women of Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white residents of San Antonio, Texas were recruited. The age of the subjects at the time of recruitment was between \num{25} and \num{64} years. As a part of the data collection, the blood glucose and insulin levels were recorded during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which measures the subject's body response to a standard \SI{75}{\gram} dose of glucose after fasting overnight. The OGTT was performed both at the baseline and follow-up phases of the study, which had an average span of \num{7.5} years. The SAHS subjects were recruited in \num{2} cohorts, the first during the period \num{1979} to \num{1982}, and the second from \num{1984} to \num{1988} \cite{haffner_hyperinsulinemia_1986}. The reassessment during the follow-up period took place during the years \num{1987} to \num{1990} for the first cohort, and \num{1991} to \num{1996} for the second cohort. For the future T2DM prediction problem, we construct the machine learning model using the data from the second cohort, in which the plasma glucose and insulin levels of \num[group-minimum-digits=4, group-separator = {,}]{1496} of healthy subjects were recorded during the OGTT at times \num{0}, \num{30}, \num{60} and \num{120} minutes in the baseline evaluation. During the course of the study, a total of \num{171} subjects developed T2DM within which \num{10} subjects also reported of at least one cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, stroke or angina.

At the follow-up assessment, the the participants were classified as having type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) or normal. For T2D diagnosis, the WHO criteria, defining fasting glucose level \SI[round-mode = off,group-separator = {,}]{\ge 126}{\milli\gram\per\deci\liter} or 2-hour glucose level \SI[round-mode = off,group-separator = {,}]{\ge 200}{\milli\gram\per\deci\liter} was followed \cite{wei_effects_1998}. Any participant reportedly taking anti-diabetic medications was also classified as diabetic. For CVD classification, any cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, stroke or angina reported by the participant, was considered as an identifier. Table \ref{tab:patients} outlines the distribution of patient classification used in this study. In order to construct a binary classifier for this study, the subjects categorized under the \texttt{DMI} and \texttt{DMI+CVD} were encoded as the positive class whereas the \texttt{Heahlty}  labels were the negative class. We restricted the classification to only two classes and the samples with the label \texttt{CVD} were ignored.

\subsection{Preparation of the Data}
%
The dataset included the glucose and insulin values recorded at the baseline, \num{30}, \num{60} and \num{120} minute intervals, and a distribution of these values marked by the follow-up labels of \texttt{healthy} and \texttt{diabetic} is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ogtt_mean}. Moreover, the socio-demographic information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index (BMI) was also part of the dataset. From the glucose and insulin measurements, we computed the slope and area under the curve between all the possible combinations  of a pair of readings. In addition, we also calculated parameters such as the insulinogenic (ratio of insulin and glucose slopes between any two time intervals) and Matsuda indices, as defined in \cite{Matsuda1462,abdul-ghani_plasma_2009}. These variables have shown a good efficacy of diabetes prediction in previous studies \cite{abdul-ghani_what_2007,abdul-ghani_plasma_2009}, since they are used to quantify the amount of insulin required by the body to maintain healthy glucose levels. In total we prepared \num{68} features for the classification problem and removed the rows that had missing entries or contained zero or infinite values.

The dataset was then partitioned into training and validation sets. As can be observed from the Table \ref{tab:patients}, the SAHS dataset is intrinsically imbalanced with the class distribution skewed toward the majority class with a ratio of 7.5:1. Considering the Therefore, we took two approaches for the training set, one in which the dataset was balanced by a randomized undersampling of the majority class, and second in which we persisted with natural class distribution. In both the cases, the validation set had the same class distribution representative of the original dataset. A total of \num{1360} samples were used for training that accounted for \SI{91}{\percent} of the dataset, and \num{99} samples, consisting of \num{11} diabetic and \num{83} healthy subjects were reserved for the validation of the trained prediction models.

\subsection{Machine Learning Framework}
%
We developed a supervised learning scheme in which the classifier output labels were obtained from the follow-up data.  We used the support vector machines (SVM) for the future diabetes prediction problem. The SVMs work on the principle of \emph{structural risk minimization} (SRM) in which the goal is to develop a model from the given training data such that it generalizes well to new datasets and minimizes the empirical risk associated with misclassification of samples in the training set \cite{vapnik_nature_2000,vapnik2015uniform}. For a binary classification problem, the developed model finds a decision boundary or a separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes.

We used the binary support vector machines (SVM) that have proven to be very effective in solving complex classification problems in many application domains, in which the data can not be easily separated into two classes. The SVM method aims to find an optimal hyperplane $\mathbf{w}_{0}\cdot \mathbf{x} + b_{0} = 0$, that maximizes the margin $d \sim 1/||\mathbf{w}||$, separating the two classes. The vector $\mathbf{x}$ denotes the training data and the vector $\mathbf{w}_0$ is a vector of weights expressed as a linear combination of the support vectors, $z_i$,
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{w}_0 = \sum ^{N}_{i=1} c_i \mathbf{z_i}.
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of support vectors in the new feature space. Once the optimal hyperplane is obtained through the transformation, the linear decision classification function can be expressed as \cite{cortes1995support}:

1. Balanced Training -> Unbalanced Validation
2. Unbalanced Training -> Balanced Validation
%
\begin{equation}
    I(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{sign} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \left( c_i \mathbf{z_i} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b_{0} \right).
\end{equation}
%
In this study, we employed the linear SVM kernel by utilizing the Matlab's \texttt{svmtrain} function. The training data was first scaled to have a unit standard deviation. The misclassification cost was configured by setting the value of the \texttt{boxconstraint} parameter to a high value of \num{100}, which would cause a stricter partitioning of the data with respect to the class labels.

To predict the future risk of type-2 diabetes, we defined a positive class (occurrence of diabetes at the follow-up) and a negative class (healthy). As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:patients}, the OGTT data used in this study is heavily unbalanced. With \num{171} positive class instances as compared to \num{1281} that of the negative class, the size of class labels is unbalanced with the ratio of positive-to-negative instances of 1:8. To avoid the problem of overfitting to the majority class during the learning phase of the technique, we under-sampled the majority class (healthy) to the size of the minority class (diabetic) by a randomly selecting equal number of samples. During the prediction model generation, we employed 10-fold cross-validation framework in which \SI{90}{\percent} of the training data, consisting of \num{360} samples was used for training and the remaining \SI{10}{\percent} was used to test the model. To validate the trained models, we used a holdout data set with the same unbalanced ratio of negative-to-positive classes in the original data, i.e., \num{11} samples of the positive class, and \num{88} samples of the negative class. We started our experiments using one feature at a time, and then more number of features were incrementally added. This exercise assists in discovering any feature dependencies. In total, we performed 1,023 classification experiments.  Each of these experiments was trained as a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and, to minimize the effect of random selection of samples from the majority class, \num{100} iterations were performed for each experiment. Owing to the small sample size of the holdout dataset, this strategy ensures the unbiased reporting of the classifier performance. To maximize reliability of the model to predict diabetes events, we maximized the recall metric during the training phase, which is defined as,
%
\begin{equation}
    Recall = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP} + \mathrm{FN}},
\end{equation}
%
where TP and FN are the true-positives and false-negatives respectively. During the validation phase, we tracked the confusion matrices for all the models yielding the maximum training recall for all the feature combinations.


\subsection{Feature Selection}
%
Before constructing the future diabetes prediction model based on the support vector machines, we aim to find the most effective subset of the features in terms of the relevance to the classifier output. This process greatly reduces the computational cost during the model development by reducing the feature space dimension and also dispense useful scientific insight in to the classification problem. We performed a two-step filter selection, first of which was the emph{filter} method in which ten features that correlated the most to the classifier target class were shortlisted. In order to define the relevance between the featue and the class labels, consider a feature $\mathbf{X}$ from a feature set $\mathcal X$ as a continuous random variable and the class label $\mathbf{Y}$ as a discrete random variable. Their relationship can be described in terms of the mutual information, $I$ defined as \cite{ross2014mutual}:
%
\begin{equation}
  I(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) = - \int p_i\ln p_i - \sum_j p_j\ln p_j + \sum_j \int p_{ij}\ln p_{ij},
  \label{eq:MI}
\end{equation}
%
where $p_{i}$ is the probability of a random variable $\mathbf{X}$ taking a particular value $x_i$ and so forth, and $p_{ij}$ denotes the joint probability $P\{\mathbf{X}= x_i, \mathbf{Y}=y_j\}$. The three terms in \eqref{eq:MI} are the continuous, discrete and joint entropies of the random variables. The features that are most relevant to the class label are the ones that individually yield the maximum $I$. However, a drawback of pursuing this approach is that the selected features may be mutually correlated, and having a redundant list of shortlisted features only adds to the computational cost of the classifier without necessarily improving its performance. Even more so, the addition of extra features commonly result in the deterioration of the classifier performance \cite{trunk1979problem}. Therefore, an instinctive way forward is to keep only one feature from a correlated set of features that provide similar relevance information, and discard the remaining features from the set $\mathcal X$. We follow the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance () algorithm \cite{mRMR}, that selects the features, that not only yield the maximal mutual information \eqref{eq:MI} with respect to the class label, but minimizes the mutual correlation among the features expressed in terms of redundancy $R$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
  R(\mathcal X) = \sum_{\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{X}_j \in \mathcal{X}} I(\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{X}_j).
  \label{eq:R}
\end{equation}
%
where $I$ is defined in \eqref{eq:MI}. By minimizing $R$, the mRMR framework selects a set of mutually exclusive features that are most relevant to the class label. In this paper, we shortlist a set of ten features that are strong predictors of the future development of type-2 diabetes. With the application of the mRMR algorithm, Table \ref{tab:ranked} shows the list of the ten features ranked in order of their relevance to the class label, where the prefixes $au$ and $sl$ denote the area under the curve and slope respectively and the time interval is shown in the subscripts.

In the second phase, we further pruned the number of features to four only by selecting the ones that provided the best performance in terms of validation accuracy using the SVM classification scheme. Table sdf shows the four best features obtained by averaging the validation accuracy over \num{100} iterations of the classification scheme.
