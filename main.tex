% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
% Do NOT use the amsbsy package under comsoc mode as that feature is
% already built into the Times Math font (newtxmath, mathtime, etc.).
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% Select a Times math font under comsoc mode or else one will automatically
% be selected for you at the document start. This is required as Communications
% Society journals use a Times, not Computer Modern, math font.
\usepackage[cmintegrals]{newtxmath}
% The freely available newtxmath package was written by Michael Sharpe and
% provides a feature rich Times math font. The cmintegrals option, which is
% the default under IEEEtran, is needed to get the correct style integral
% symbols used in Communications Society journals. Version 1.451, July 28,
% 2015 or later is recommended. Also, do *not* load the newtxtext.sty package
% as doing so would alter the main text font.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtx
%
% Alternatively, you can use the MathTime commercial fonts if you have them
% installed on your system:
%\usepackage{mtpro2}
%\usepackage{mt11p}
%\usepackage{mathtime}

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.

\begin{abstract}
We present a prediction model that assesses the future risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We use the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data collected from a group of 1,551  healthy subjects to construct a machine learning model employing the support vector machines. We trained and validated the models on the data obtained from the second cohort of the San Antonio Heart Study, using a set of four features derived from the glucose measurements in the OGTT. The results of the proposed scheme show a mean validation accuracy of 97.23\% and recall of 77.27\%. The results also show that the plasma glucose based features show the maximum relevance regards to predicting the development of T2DM in future.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} global incidence of diabetes was estimated at \num{422} million in the year \num{2014} and its prevalence among the adult population has seen an increase from \SI{4.7}{\percent} in the year \num{1980} to \SI{8.5}{\percent} in \num{2014} \cite{mathers_projections_2006}. In \num{2015} alone, an estimated \num{1.6} million deaths worldwide were attributed to diabetes. In addition, a diabetic patient is at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, visual impairment and limb amputations, as compared to a non-diabetic person. Due to the substantial socio-economic burdens that are associated with diabetes, its early detection, intervention and prevention has become a worldwide top-level health concern.


%%% TALK ABOUT GLUCOSE TOLERANCE
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), defined by World Health Organization (WHO) \cite{organization_definition_2006} and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) \cite{american_diabetes_association_diagnosis_2005}, that is used to detect diabetes in its early stage, known as pre-diabetes, which identifies the impaired insulin response. Glucose clamp techniques can quantify the IGT. However, such techniques are labor-intensive and complicated for clinical practice or large epidemiological studies. A less invasive technique to quantify IGT involves an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that samples the blood concentration of glucose and insulin over 2 hours after a standardized glucose dose  \cite{tschritter_assessing_2003}. However, the studies have shown that only \SI{50}{\percent} of such cases actually develop diabetes within a span of \num{10} years \cite{shaw_impaired_1999, writing_committee_impaired_2002}. Moreover, \SI{40}{\percent} diabetic subjects do not show any IGT in the initial screening. Previous studies have shown that extended OGTT, that assesses the blood glucose and insulin in the period prior to \SI{2}{\hour} limit, can predict diabetes onset more reliably \cite{abdul-ghani_what_2007}.


%%% TALK ABOUT INSULIN RESISTANCE
In this paper, we revisit the data generated by a population-based, epidemiological study, the San Antonio Heart Study \cite{burke_rapid_1999, lorenzo_trend_2006}, and use a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes by using predefined OGTT features used earlier in the literature. On top of a range of glucose and insulin concentrations and their derivatives, our approach also takes into account physiological factors such as age, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI).

\section{Materials and Methods}
%
\subsection{San Antonio Heart Study}
%
We developed the diabetes prediction models using the data extracted from a population-based epidemiological study, the San Antonio Heart Study (SAHS). The aim of the SAHS was to assess the risk factors of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases \cite{burke_rapid_1999, lorenzo_trend_2006}, for which  5,158 men and non-pregnant women of Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white residents of San Antonio, Texas were recruited. The age of the subjects at the time of recruitment was between \num{25} and \num{64} years. As a part of the data collection, the blood glucose and insulin levels were recorded during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which measures the subject's body response to a standard \SI{75}{\gram} dose of glucose after fasting overnight. The OGTT was performed both at the baseline and follow-up phases of the study, which had an average span of \num{7.5} years. The SAHS subjects were recruited in \num{2} cohorts, the first during the period \num{1979} to \num{1982}, and the second from \num{1984} to \num{1988} \cite{haffner_hyperinsulinemia_1986}. The reassessment during the follow-up period took place during the years \num{1987} to \num{1990} for the first cohort, and \num{1991} to \num{1996} for the second cohort. For the future T2DM prediction problem, we construct the machine learning model using the data from the second cohort, in which the plasma glucose and insulin levels of \num[round-mode = off,group-separator = {,}]{1496} of healthy subjects were recorded during the OGTT at times \num{0}, \num{30}, \num{60} and \num{120} minutes in the baseline evaluation. During the course of the study, a total of 171 subjects developed T2DM within which 10 subjects also reported of at least one cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, stroke or angina.

At the follow-up assessment, the the participants were classified as having type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) or normal. For T2D diagnosis, the WHO criteria, defining fasting glucose level \SI[round-mode = off,group-separator = {,}]{\ge 126}{\milli\gram\per\deci\liter} or 2-hour glucose level \SI[round-mode = off,group-separator = {,}]{\ge 200}{\milli\gram\per\deci\liter} was followed \cite{wei_effects_1998}. Any participant reportedly taking anti-diabetic medications was also classified as diabetic. For CVD classification, any cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, stroke or angina reported by the participant, was considered as an identifier. Table \ref{tab:patients} outlines the distribution of patient classification used in this study. In order to construct a binary classifier for this study, the subjects categorized under DMI and DMI+CVD were encoded by 1 whereas 0 was the label assigned to the healthy subjects. The subjects under the CVD catergory wrer not considered.

\subsection{Preparation of the Data}
%
We excluded the participants with any missing values. The dataset included the ethnicity and Two socio-demographic factors (age and ethnicity), and eight physiological factors either measured during the OGTT or derived later, were used in this study, listed in Table \ref{tab:features}. These features have previously been used in diabetes prediction studies \cite{abdul-ghani_what_2007,abdul-ghani_plasma_2009}. The area under the \SI{2}{\hour} glucose curve ($\textrm{AuG}_{0-120}$) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule, while the Matsuda index (M) was used as defined in \cite{Matsuda1462}. \( {\Delta I}/{\Delta G}_{0-120} \), where $x = 30, 120$ was calculated using the measured insulin and glucose values at time x during the OGTT.

\subsection{Machine Learning Technique}
% 



\subsection{Feature Selection}
% 
Before constructing the diabetes prediction model, we aim to find the most effective subset of the features in terms of the relevance to the classifier output. This process greatly reduces the computational cost during the model development by reducing the feature space dimension and also dispense useful scientific insight in to the classification problem. Here, we pursue the so-called \emph{feature selection} process using the \emph{filter} method, where the features that correlate the most to the classifier target class are shortlisted. Let us consider a feature $\mathbf{X}$ as a continuous random variable and the class label $\mathbf{Y}$ as a discrete random variable. The correlation or relevance between the two random variables can be described in terms of the mutual information, $I$ defined as:
% 
\begin{equation}
    I(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}) = - \int p_i\ln p_i - \sum_j p_j\ln p_j + \sum_j \int p_{ij}\ln p_{ij},
    \label{eq:MI}
\end{equation}
% 
where $p_{i}$ is the probability of a random variable $\mathbf{X}$ taking a particular value $x_i$ and so forth, and $p_{ij}$ denotes the joint probability $P\{\mathbf{X}= x_i, \mathbf{Y}=y_j\}$. The three terms in \eqref{eq:MI} are the continuous, discrete and joint entropies of the random variables. The set of features that individually yield the maximum $I$ are termed as the most relevant features. A downside of this approach is that the obtained subset of features may not be mutually independent of each other. This redundancy in the feature list only adds in to the computational cost and does not improve the classifier performance. Therefore, we aim to select the features that yield maximized relevance along with minimal redundancy which is defined as:
% 
contain independent individual features that are depen
% 



We use the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm \cite{mRMR} to reduce the feature space     In the proposed method, we first simplify the feature space by selecting the top ten features that carry the maximum relevance with the classifier output, namely the labels. For this purpose, we used the maximum-relevance, minimal-redundancy (mR-mR) algorithm to rank the ten best features based on the. The mRmR algorithm is a type of filter method for feature selection in which individual features are ranked based on the mutual information they have with the classifier output. Mathematically, the mutual information MI between two random variables $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
    I(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{C}) = \int \int p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}) \log \frac{\p(x)}
\end{equation}

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
\section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
