	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — With the current obesity epidemic, one would expect a prevalence increase in the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based study with worsening obesity, we examined the metabolic syndrome and its effect on incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We enrolled 5,158 subjects in two cohorts: 1979 –1982 and 1984 –1988. We reexamined 3,682 (71.4\%) subjects in 1987–1990 (cohort 1) and 1991–1996 (cohort 2) and assessed a 7.5-year incidence of CVD in 4,635 (90.0\%) participants. We used the metabolic syndrome deﬁnition of the National Cholesterol Education Program–Adult Treatment Panel III.
RESULTS — At baseline, the metabolic syndrome was less prevalent in cohort 1 than in cohort 2: in men, 20.4 vs. 29.3\% (P Ͻ 0.001); in women, 16.3 vs. 26.3\% (P Ͻ 0.001). The prevalence increased in men and women of both Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white ethnic groups between 1979 –1982 and 1991–1996 (P for trend Ͻ0.001 for each of the groups). There was an excess of incident CVD in cohort 2 relative to cohort 1 (odds ratio 1.37 [95\% CI 1.02–1.84]) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, history of CVD, diabetes, total cholesterol, smoking, and family history of heart attack. Further adjustment for the metabolic syndrome reduced this difference (1.26 [0.93–1.71]) because the metabolic syndrome predicted incident CVD (1.58 [1.14 –2.18]).
CONCLUSIONS — In San Antonio, Texas, an increase in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome between 1979 –1982 and 1984 –1988 contributes to explain a higher CVD incidence.},

We analysed indices of sensitivity (Matsuda index) and secretion from the early (ΔI0-30/ΔG0-30) and late oral glucose tolerance test periods (I/GAUC 60-120).
Results—A total of 179 participants developed diabetes after 7.5 years. I/GAUC60-120 was an independent predictor of diabetes [odds ratio × 1 SD unit increase, 0.37 (0.26–0.54)] in a model that also included age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, family history of diabetes, Matsuda index and (ΔI 0-30/ΔG0-30) as covariates. I/GAUC 60–120 increased the C statistic (a test of discrimination) of the model (0.882 vs. 0.875, P = 0.044). I/GAUC 60–120 correctly reclassified onefifth of individuals with moderate and strong risks of future diabetes. The net reclassification improvement was 0.13 (P {\textless} 0.001) and the integrated discrimination improvement was 0.033 (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions—An insulin secretory measure derived from the late oral glucose tolerance test period is useful for classifying individuals at risk of future diabetes independently of other risk factors, including insulin sensitivity and a secretory measure from the early oral glucose tolerance test period.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVEdThe Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) reported no racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that factors associated with racial/ethnic disparities act prior to the development of IGT. Because impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and obesity were also very prevalent in the DPP, we examined IGT, IFG, and obesity as effect modiﬁers of ethnic disparities in the San Antonio Heart Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdParticipants were 3,015 Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites aged 25–64 years. The median follow-up period was 7.8 years. IGT, IFG, and diabetes were deﬁned by the 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria, and obesity was deﬁned as BMI \$30 kg/m2.
RESULTSdMexican Americans had an excess risk of incident IGT (odds ratio 1.48 [95\% CI 1.16–1.89]) and incident IFG (1.71 [1.31–2.23]) compared with non-Hispanic whites. Mexican Americans also had a higher incidence of diabetes among individuals who had normal 2-h glucose (2.20 [1.48–3.29]) and IGT (1.72 [1.08–2.74]) at baseline. There was an interaction of obesity on the relationship between ethnicity and progression to IGT or diabetes (P = 0.034), with Mexican Americans having a greater risk among the nonobese (1.73 [1.36–2.21]) and a comparable risk among the obese (1.08 [0.75–1.56]).
CONCLUSIONSdEthnic differences can be detected at both the early and later stages of the diabetes disease process. However, non-Hispanic whites lose much of the ethnic advantage once they have developed obesity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — The prospective association between insulin levels and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is controversial. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), as well as insulin levels, with risk of nonfatal and fatal CVD over the 8-year follow-up of the San Antonio Heart Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Between 1984 and 1988, randomly selected Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white residents of San Antonio participated in baseline examinations that included fasting blood samples for glucose, insulin, and lipids, a glucose tolerance test, anthropometric measurements, and a lifestyle questionnaire. Between 1991 and 1996, 2,569 subjects who were free of diabetes at baseline were reexamined using the same protocol.
RESULTS — Over the follow-up period, 187 subjects experienced an incident cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke, heart surgery, angina, or CVD death). Logistic regression analysis indicated that risk of a CVD event increased across quintiles of HOMA-IR after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (P for trend Ͻ0.0001; quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, odds ratio [OR] 2.52, 95\% CI 1.46 – 4.36). Additional adjustment for LDL, triglyceride, HDL, systolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, and waist circumference only modestly reduced the magnitude of these associations (P for trend 0.02; quintile 5 vs. quintile 1, OR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.05–3.59). Furthermore, there were no signiﬁcant interactions between HOMA-IR and ethnicity, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose tolerance (impaired glucose tolerance versus normal glucose tolerance), or obesity. The magnitude and direction of the relationship between insulin concentration and incident CVD were similar.
CONCLUSIONS — We found a signiﬁcant association between HOMA-IR and risk of CVD after adjustment for multiple covariates. The topic remains controversial, however, and additional studies are required, particularly among women and minority populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — Although the level of hyperglycemia is clearly a risk factor for microvascular complications in diabetic patients, its role in macrovascular complications remains controversial. We followed 4,875 subjects (65\% Mexican-American) for 7-8 years to investigate the effects of diabetes and hyperglycemia on all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality These end points were also analyzed according to quartiles of baseline fasting plasma glucose among diabetic participants. RESEARCH DESIGN A N D METHODS— The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) for all-cause and CVD mortality
RESULTS — Diabetes was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality (RR [95\% Cl] = 2.1 [1.3-3.5] in men; 3.2 [1.9-5.4] in women) and increased CVD mortality (3.2 [1.4-7.1] in men; 8.5 [2.8-23.2] in women). Among diabetic subjects, those in quartile 4 had a 4.2-fold greater risk of all-cause mortality (P {\textless} 0.001) and a 4.7-fold greater risk of CVD mortality (P = 0.01) than those in quartiles 1 and 2 combined. After further adjustment for other potential risk factors, subjects in quartile 4 had a 4.9-fold greater risk of all-cause mortality and a 4.9-fold greater risk of CVD mortality than those in quartiles 1 and 2. In addition, hypertension, current smoking, and cholesterol {\textgreater}6.2 mmol/1 were significant predictors of CVD mortality using Cox models. effects of glycemia on botb fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) end points were independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, notably lipids and lipoproteins, which were themselves significant predictors of CHD end points (6). These issues, however, have not been addressed in Mexican-Americans. We have previously reported that Mexican-Americans have a high prevalence and incidence of diabetes (9,10). In addition, a previous analysis showed that diabetes was associated with high CVD and all-cause mortality in this population (3). However, a sex-specific analysis was not performed at that time because of the small sample size resulting from partial follow-up of the overall cohort. We have now completed the follow-up on the entire cohort and have, therefore, reanalyzed the association between diabetes and all-cause and CVD monality by sex. In addition, we have assessed the effects ofriskfac;tors on all-cause and CVD mortality in diabetic participants.
CONCLUSIONS — We conclude that diabetes is a predictor of both all-cause and CVD mortality in the general population and that both hyperglycemia and common CVD risk factors are important predictors of all-cause and CVD mortality in diabetic subjects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—To develop a model for the prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk on the basis of a multivariate logistic model and 1-h plasma glucose concentration (1-h PG). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—The model was developed in a cohort of 1,562 nondiabetic subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study (SAHS) and validated in 2,395 nondiabetic subjects in the Botnia Study. A risk score on the basis of anthropometric parameters, plasma glucose and lipid proﬁle, and blood pressure was computed for each subject. Subjects with a risk score above a certain cut point were considered to represent high-risk individuals, and their 1-h PG concentration during the oral glucose tolerance test was used to further reﬁne their future T2DM risk.
RESULTS—We used the San Antonio Diabetes Prediction Model (SADPM) to generate the initial risk score. A risk-score value of 0.065 was found to be an optimal cut point for initial screening and selection of high-risk individuals. A 1-h PG concentration .140 mg/dL in highrisk individuals (whose risk score was .0.065) was the optimal cut point for identiﬁcation of subjects at increased risk. The two cut points had 77.8, 77.4, and 44.8\% (for the SAHS) and 75.8, 71.6, and 11.9\% (for the Botnia Study) sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and positive predictive value, respectively, in the SAHS and Botnia Study.
CONCLUSIONS—A two-step model, based on the combination of the SADPM and 1-h PG, is a useful tool for the identiﬁcation of high-risk Mexican-American and Caucasian individuals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE — We sought to assess insulin secretion/insulin resistance index in predicting the risk for future type 2 diabetes RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 1,551 nondiabetic subjects from the San Antonio Heart Study received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with measurement of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min at baseline and after 7– 8 years of follow-up. Insulin secretion/insulin resistance index was calculated as the product of Matsuda index and ⌬I0 –30/⌬G0 –30 or ⌬I0 –120/⌬G0 –120. The discriminatory power of various prediction models for development of type 2 diabetes was tested with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS — Insulin secretion/insulin resistance index (0- to 30- and 0- to 120-min time periods) had the greatest areas under the ROC curve (0.85 and 0.86, respectively), which were signiﬁcantly greater than the 2-h plasma glucose concentration during the OGTT or the San Antonio Diabetes Prediction Model (SADPM) (P Ͻ 0.001 and P Ͻ 0.0001, respectively). A model based on the combination of the SADPM and a modiﬁed version of the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index or 1-h plasma glucose concentration had equal power to predict the risk for future type 2 diabetes compared with the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index.
CONCLUSIONS — The insulin secretion/insulin resistance index is useful as a predictor of future development of type 2 diabetes. A model based on the combination of the SADPM and either a modiﬁed version of the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index or 1-h plasma glucose concentration can equally predict future type 2 diabetes.},

A variety of multivariate models, based on measurements taken during the fasting state, have been developed. Although, in general, these models are useful tools for identifying subjects at increased risk for future type 2 diabetes, they correlate poorly with ␤-cell failure, the principal factor responsible for the progressive deterioration of glucose tolerance, and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes.

Methods 2445 non-diabetic subjects from the Botnia study received an OGTT at baseline and after 7–8 years of follow-up.
Results NGT and IFG subjects who returned their plasma glucose concentration following an ingested glucose load below FPG within 60 min had increased insulin sensitivity, greater insulin secretion and lower risk for future T2DM compared to NGT and IFG subjects whose post-load plasma glucose concentration required 120 min or longer to return their plasma glucose level to FPG level. IGT subjects who had a lower plasma glucose concentration at 1-h compared to 2-h during OGTT had greater insulin sensitivity, better beta cell function and lower risk for future T2DM.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — OGTT data from 551 subjects (485 with normal glucose tolerance [NGT] and 66 with impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) were analyzed. We distinguished between “monophasic,” “biphasic,” and unclassiﬁed glucose shapes. A “shape” index based on the extent and the direction of the plasma glucose change in the second hour allowed us to treat shape as a continuous variable.
RESULTS — In the biphasic group, the NGT-to-IGT ratio was slightly higher (173/20 vs. 209/40, P ϭ 0.08) and the male-to-female ratio was lower (60/133 vs. 120/129, P ϭ 0.0003). Subjects with a biphasic shape had signiﬁcantly lower age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), HbA1c, plasma glucose, and area under the insulin curve (insulinAUC) and a better estimated insulin sensitivity and secretion (using validated indexes) than monophasic subjects (all P Ͻ 0.05). By adjusting this shape index for glucoseAUC (as continuous measure of glucose tolerance), correlations with age, BMI, WHR, HbA1c, and insulinAUC were completely abolished. The adjusted shape index was still higher in female than in male subjects but lower in IGT than in NGT subjects (both P ϭ 0.0003). Finally, we tested common polymorphisms in insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, calpain-10, hepatic lipase, and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-␥ for association with the shape index.
CONCLUSIONS — We conclude that the plasma glucose shape during an OGTT depends on glucose tolerance and sex. In addition, genetic factors seem to play a role. The shape index may be a useful metabolic screening parameter in epidemiological and genetic association studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several methods have been proposed to evaluate insulin sensitivity from the data obtained from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, the validity of these indices has not been rigorously evaluated by comparing them with the direct measurement of insulin sensitivity obtained with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. In this study, we compare various insulin sensitivity indices derived from the OGTT with whole-body insulin sensitivity measured by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 153 subjects (66 men and 87 women, aged 18-71 years, BMI 20-65 kg/m2) with varying degrees of glucose tolerance (62 subjects with normal glucose tolerance, 31 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and 60 subjects with type 2 diabetes) were studied. After a 10-h overnight fast, all subjects underwent, in random order, a 75-g OGTT and a euglycemic insulin clamp, which was performed with the infusion of [3-3H]glucose. The indices of insulin sensitivity derived from OGTT data and the euglycemic insulin clamp were compared by correlation analysis. RESULTS: The mean plasma glucose concentration divided by the mean plasma insulin concentration during the OGTT displayed no correlation with the rate of whole-body glucose disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp (r = -0.02, NS). From the OGTT, we developed an index of whole-body insulin sensitivity (10,000/square root of [fasting glucose x fasting insulin] x [mean glucose x mean insulin during OGTT]), which is highly correlated (r = 0.73, P \&lt; 0.0001) with the rate of whole-body glucose disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp. CONCLUSIONS: Previous methods used to derive an index of insulin sensitivity from the OGTT have relied on the ratio of plasma glucose to insulin concentration during the OGTT. Our results demonstrate the limitations of such an approach. We have derived a novel estimate of insulin sensitivity that is simple to calculate and provides a reasonable approximation of whole-body insulin sensitivity from the OGTT.},
